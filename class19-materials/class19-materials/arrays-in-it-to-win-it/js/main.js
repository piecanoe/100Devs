//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let newArr = ['Brink!', 'Johnny Tsunami', 'Rip Girls']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = newArr[newArr.length - 1]
